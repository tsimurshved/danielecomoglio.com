A visit to Brazil in 2018 for a concert tour was the spark to start writing the music on the album. A journey into ten original songs that mix smooth jazz atmospheres with ingredients from Brazilian music, African music, R&B and, of course, jazz as a trait d’union. Stories and sounds with the flavor of distant places.
